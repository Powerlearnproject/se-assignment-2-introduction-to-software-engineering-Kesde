Question three:
Phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, including:

- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
  Question four: Agile and Waterfall compared:
- Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.While,
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
    Quetion five: Levels of software testing:
    Unit Testing
    Verify that individual components or units of the software function correctly.
    Integration Testing
    Ensure that different units or components of the software work together as expected.
    System Testing
    Validate that the complete and integrated software system meets the specified requirements.
    Acceptance Testing
    The objective is to confirm that the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
    Why is software testing important:
    Testing is essential for delivering high-quality, reliable, and secure software. Testing is also important because it:
    • Ensures Quality
    • Detects Bugs Early
    • Enhances Security
    • Improves Performance
    • Boosts User Satisfaction
    • Facilitates Maintenance
    • Reduces Risk
    Question six: What are version control systems?
    Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to source code and other collections of files over time. They allow multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary.
    Importance of version control systems:
    Collaboration:

Enable multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
Facilitate distributed development with seamless integration of changes from different team members.
Tracking Changes:

Maintain a detailed history of all modifications made to the codebase, including what was changed, who made the changes, and when they were made.
Help in understanding the evolution of the project and the rationale behind changes.
Reversion and Recovery:

Allow developers to revert to previous versions of the code if issues arise, facilitating quick recovery from mistakes or bugs.
Provide a reliable backup of the entire project, safeguarding against data loss.
Branching and Merging:

Support the development of new features or bug fixes in isolated branches, which can be tested and merged into the main codebase once stable.
Enable parallel development streams, reducing the risk of integration conflicts.
Conflict Resolution:

Help manage and resolve conflicts that occur when changes from different developers overlap, ensuring a smooth integration process.
Code Quality:

Facilitate code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration, leading to higher quality and more reliable software.
Accountability and Auditability:

Provide transparency and accountability by recording who made each change, which is useful for auditing and understanding contributions.
Examples of version control systems:
Local Version Control Systems:

Simple systems that track changes to files on a local machine.
Example: RCS (Revision Control System).
Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS):

Use a central server to store all versions of the project files.
Developers check out files from the central repository, make changes, and commit them back.
Examples: CVS (Concurrent Versions System), Subversion (SVN).
Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS):

Each developer has a complete local copy of the entire project history.
Changes are committed locally and then pushed to a central repository or shared with others.
Examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar.
